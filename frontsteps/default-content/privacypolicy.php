	<b>Automatic Logging of Session Data</b><br>
	We automatically log generic information about your computer's connection to the Internet, which we call

	software being used and the activities conducted by the user while on our site. An IP address is a number that
	lets computers attached to the Internet, such as our web servers, know where to send data back to the user, such
	as the pages of the site the user wishes to view. We collect session data because it helps us analyze such
	things as what items visitors are likely to click on most, the way visitors are clicking through the site, how
	many visitors are surfing to various pages on the site, how long visitors to the site are staying and how often
	they are visiting. It also helps us diagnose problems with our servers and lets us better administer our
	systems. It is possible to determine from an IP address a visitor's Internet Service Provider (ISP) and the
	approximate geographic location of his or her point of connectivity. We may also use some session data, such as
	the pages you visited on our site, to send you e-mail unless you had previously opted out of receiving such
	messages.
